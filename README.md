# US States as Squares

US states rendered as squares for use in data visualization. Inspired by https://github.com/hrbrmstr/statebins/blob/master/README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png

This is a static GeoJSON file that renders the US states as squares. The location data is completely arbitrary and this data set is not intended for use in spatial analysis. I wanted this data set because I do a lot of data processing with GIS tools so I can join these features with any state-level analysis results I produce. The geometry itself would not be useful for actual mapping, but will be suitable in visualization tools such as D3.
